A ruby-powered server application (usually running [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)) serves an API to a rich Javascript client application.\r\n\r\nThe Javascript application is usually built using a framework such as [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) or [Batman.js](http://batmanjs.org/) to build the User Interface, persist data to the API, etc...\r\n\r\n### Contact Info\r\nFeel free to use my Github profile to contact me: @loginx\r\n","google":"","name":"Xavier Spriet","tagline":"Full Stack web developer"}
